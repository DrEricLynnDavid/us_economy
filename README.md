Excel workbook that collects and analyzes data comparing and contrasting presidents and congress influence on U.S. economy.
Analysis of U.S. Economy Based on Party and Presidency

Each voting cycle, a great deal of hype encircles voting party, presidency, and congress. Often, the economy is the primary indicator of how well our government does in terms of managing this country.

Each voting cycle, a great deal of hype encircles voting party, presidency, and congress in terms of how they will manage this country's economy---above all other matters.

The purpose for this unbiased study is to show correlations---where they exist---between voting party, presidency, and congress in terms of economy. Is there an influence or not? Is it coincidental? What are some external factors that occurred each year that may have contributed to an economic impact of some kind?

Note about interest rates: the Federal Reserve is the primary driver behind this metric, so it is not worth analyzing in this study.

The author of this study is indifferent regarding voting parties, so no bias is shown in the analysis of data results. This is purely an analytical output from varying data ssources.

Note: because this is Excel, it might flag some users (depending on their security settings). There is nothing malicious in this workbook.
